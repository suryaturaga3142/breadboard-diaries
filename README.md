# Breadboard Diaries

I really enjoy breadboarding. Not just putting stuff together with wires and measuring results. I see my breadboard as a canvas, a blank slate upon which I can bring my ideas to life. I know how long each of my wire sets are, so I know how to position stuff to look really neat. It's a fun exercise that keeps me destressed. I've worked on a couple projects so far, some being part of courses where I get to choose my topic. It's hard to do much with coursework taking up time, but I generally try to stay in touch with breadboards through 1 project per semester. I like analog. So here's a small summary of the projects in my repo.

> Not all my projects are available. Projects like the audio equalizer are a part of coursework related to ECE 20007, a course for which I am a Teaching Assistant. So I'm not keeping any of that available publicly.

## Audio Equalizer

This is a simple project made in 2024 to seperate an AUX cable signal into 3 groups, seperately amplify / reduce, and a final stage for recombinatuon and power amplifying. Can't show details on this one since I'm a TA for this class.
